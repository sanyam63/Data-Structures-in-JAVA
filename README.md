# Data-Structures-in-JAVA
(Work in progress)
This repository contains DSA codes WITHOUT using collection classes.
I wrote this because I could not find these codes in java easily and thought it would be wise to upload them at one place for 
anyone's references.
Without the use of collection class, it's easy to understand concepts.
